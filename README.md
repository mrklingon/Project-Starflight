# Project-Starflight
Simple space game in PyBasic and CircuitPython

I wanted to go old-school and write a program in BASIC using [PyBasic](https://github.com/richpl/PyBasic) - worked fine, but then I wanted it in CircuitPython, so I asked duck.ai to find an AI that could do that. Worked fine and I just needed a couple of tweeks to get it to  work in CircuitPython. Runs fine on FruitJam and even NeoTrinkey (using the REPL in Mu.)

I used [FantasyNameGenerators.com](FantasyNameGenerators.com) to create the ship names, stars and planets.

Your job is to pilot your ship until you can reach the
